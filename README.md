# Basic Authorization
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanheemstra/15-basic_auth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanheemstra/15-basic_auth)

## About
The basic authorization app currently allows a user to sign up `POST` and sign in `GET`. The application will provide a light layer of encryption by hashing the password before storing it in the database. Each user gets 4 properties `email`, `password`, `username`, and `findHash`. When creating a user the `email`, `password`, and `username` are required. The `findHash` is generated by the application.

## Starting the application
In order to run any of the CRUD operations available you will need to first install all dependencies by running `npm i` in the terminal. After installing all dependencies you need to run the server before any routes can be hit. To turn on the server run `npm start` in the terminal. Then in a separate terminal window you will now be able to run any of the Route commands listed below.

_Note: you will need to be in the root file directory of the application in order to run any of the CRUD routes._

## POST Routes
### POST - Create User - Sign up
#### `/api/signup`
* Create a new User via a POST request using HTTPie by using the following terminal command:
  * `http POST :<PORT NUMBER>/api/signup username='<UNIQUE USERNAME>' password='<PASSWORD>' email='<UNIQUE EMAIL>'`
  * _IMPORTANT: A USER MUST BE CREATED BEFORE YOU CAN CREATE A GALLERY OR UPLOAD AN IMAGE_
