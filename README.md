## About
Fomogram (Fear Of Missing Out-gram) is a way in which you can upload images and complete with your friends to see who is having the best time. Now you don't have to wonder if your friends are having more fun than you, you can see that they are. ;)

Fomogram is a basic gallery application that allows a visitor to create a user, gallery, and upload images to Amazon S3.

## Starting the application
In order to run any of the CRUD operations available you will need to first install all dependencies by running `npm i` in the terminal. After installing all dependencies you need to run the server before any routes can be hit. To turn on the server run `npm start` in the terminal. Then in a separate terminal window you will now be able to run any of the Route commands listed below.

_Note: you will need to be in the root file directory of the application in order to run any of the CRUD routes._
